INTRODUCTION 						*wsl-clip-intro*


This plugin provides access to the Windows system clipboard for terminal Vim running in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). The default installation of Vim on WSL assumes no clipboard as WSL is running in a terminal and not with a window manager. It is designed to work in a similar fashion to setting `clipboard=unnamed` as it automatically puts any yanked text into the system clipboard and the contents of the system clipboard are automatically available for putting using the normal put commands. No special keys are required. There is no requirement to install vim on WSL with clipboard support (i.e installing vim-gnome) or installing an X server.

The vim-term-focus plugin is required to allow Vim to detect change of focus

			The external command used to set the system clipboard
			with the contents of the yank buffer. The command is
			set to `clip.exe` by default unless `win32yank` is

			The external command use to get the system clipboard
			which is then placed in the default paste register as
			defined in |g:wsl_clip_default_paste_register|. The command is
			set to `powershell.exe` by default unless `win32yank` is
			is in the path which will be used instead.

							*g:wsl_clip_default_paste_register*
g:wsl_clip_default_paste_register 	string 	(default ")
			The register that is set with the contents of the
			system clipboard when focus is regained. The unnamed
			register is the default so that that it can be used by
			the put command with no register specified.

							*g:wsl_clip_extra_paste_register*
g:wsl_clip_extra_paste_register    string (default 1)
			An additional register that the system clipboard is
			written to in case of accidental overwriting of the
			default paste register with a delete command (for
			example).

							*g:wsl_clip_strip_last_CRLF*
g:wsl_clip_strip_last_CRLF 	boolean 	(default 0)
			Automatically strip last CRLF characters from the
			contents of the system clipboard before putting in the
			paste register. Some clipboard programs add an extra
			CRLF onto the clipboard. This strips them off if
			necessary. If using `win32yank` this is done
			automatically using the --crlf flag.
